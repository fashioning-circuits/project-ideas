Fall 2013 Ideas
===============

Kim Knight testing the project based on Harrison' instructions. Had to open f13-ideas in smultron. Cannot edit in Git? That seems to be true. This is still very early so I would take out the part about links to resources. Just looking for an idea dump paragraph at this point. 

May need to add step by step instructions for clarity.
0. Download text editor?
1. Fork repository
2. Clone on local machine
3. Insert paragraph. 
4. Commit
5. Pull request
â€¦and so on...

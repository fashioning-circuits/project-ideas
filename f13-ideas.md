Fall 2013 Ideas

As a lover of music, I have an idea for a project that somehow visually demonstrates the emotions that music incites within people. Music is a significant part of pop culture, but it is also an essential part of our lives in general. It has been proven to affect our moods, the quality of our work, and the way we think. I think it is important to draw attention to that. The only idea that I have so far on how to do this would be with some kind of sound activated, volume sensitive lighting. People tend to feel more profound emotions when music gets louder, whether it be because of volume, or because of added instruments or layers of sound. So I picture more lights being on, or the lights being brighter, as a result of the music getting louder. Possibly something similar to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxpu41EQ78s). I'm still unsure about how to incorporate it into a wearable object, but I believe it should be worn on the torso area of the body to symbolize the emotions that "run through you" when you are listening.


I have noticed how much trouble little kids have with getting their shoes on the correct feet and also how much they love things (especially shoes) that light up. I want to combine these observations to create shoes that are able to actually tell the child when their shoes are on the right or wrong feet. I want to do this by using various LEDs, sensors, and possibly sounds to create something that makes it fun and interactive for the child while also teaching them where their shoes belong.

As a lover of music, I have an idea for a project that somehow visually demonstrates the emotions that music incites within people. Music is a significant part of pop culture, but it is also an essential part of our lives in general. It has been proven to affect our moods, the quality of our work, and the way we think. I think it is important to draw attention to that. The only idea that I have so far on how to do this would be with some kind of sound activated, volume sensitive lighting. People tend to feel more profound emotions when music gets louder, whether it be because of volume, or because of added instruments or layers of sound. So I picture more lights being on, or the lights being brighter, as a result of the music getting louder. Possibly something similar to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxpu41EQ78s). I'm still unsure about how to incorporate it into a wearable object, but I believe it should be worn on the torso area of the body to symbolize the emotions that "run through you" when you are listening.

I have noticed how much trouble little kids have with getting their shoes on the correct feet and also how much they love things (especially shoes) that light up. I want to combine these observations to create shoes that are able to actually tell the child when their shoes are on the right or wrong feet. I want to do this by using various LEDs, sensors, and possibly sounds to create something that makes it fun and interactive for the child while also teaching them where their shoes belong. I think this would be both important and helpful in that it is teaching a child a relatively important concept that most of us simply take for granted.

I have been having a hard time thinking of something to do for this project, but I would like to do something music releated as it is a big part of my life. I was thinking about possibly making a t-shirt with speakers and a graphic equalizer on the front that you could plug into your phone or .mp3 player or maybe a wearable guitar amp. The social context aspect has been the hardest part to integrate into my idea, but I'll come up with something.

It's no secret that I love me some comic books. Marvel and DC have tried some augmented reality with their comics, but with little success. I was thinking about integrating some sound of sound or LED devide that triggers when you are reading comics. Maybe with a t-shirt or a wrist band, something that will do something visually or with audio when flipping through pages.

Mental illness is an invisible illness, but that doesn't make it any less real. Because it may not be obvious to others who suffers from these mental illnesses, it can be really easy to spread misconceptions about the "type" of person who has them or how you can deal with it. That said, I want to create a project that focuses on visibility and destigmatization of mental illness. For me, my depression manifests as feelings of anxiety and being overwhelmed to the point where it's hard to get out of bed or get anything done. That said, I'm considering a project that uses an accelerometer or GPS (if that can be done??) to "sense" how much the wearer is getting done and lights up accordingly. Another idea would be a visual representation of what kind of day the wearer is having-- some days I feel totally fine and function regularly; others, I just don't have the spoons. Because this fluctuates, it can be hard for others to understand that mental illness is to blame and that I'm not just being "lazy."

I've been exploring several ideas around the idea of privacy. I am a member of the school's Computer Security Group where I am giving a demonstration on physical security. In researching this topic, I've been learning about the many facets of pervasive security culture (be it CCTV, RFID-controlled, auto-locking doors, or cell phone monitoring). The project ideas that I've come up with are varied. Some are closer to ready-to-wear design intended to maximize utility. Other concepts are intended more as statement pieces, avant garde and impractical. The utility ideas are: IR-shielding clothing, an RFID-snatching wand/sleeve/glove/garment, taser-proof clothing, and a compact that——instead of [just?] showing your reflection——tells you if you can be recognized by facial identification software. On the more performative end of things: literal cages that act as Faraday cages, masking the wearers from detection through cell signal; security camera themed clothing; fake Google Glass; an orange prison jumpsuit with a live counter on incarceration numbers; and a cell phone case that is connected with a cuff of a handcuff, called "Tethered." I want to play with the concepts of security, privacy, and guilt by juxtaposing the contemporary with the dystopian-sounding predictions of the past that describes so perfectly our modern world (Brave New World, 1984, V for Vendetta, &c.).
